Before coding, read these files:
- steering-docs/PROJECT_TRUTHWATCHER.md
- steering-docs/AGENT_COLLABORATION_CONTRACT.md
- steering-docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md
- steering-docs/DATA_MODEL.md
- steering-docs/SAFETY_MODEL.md
- steering-docs/MVP_SPEC.md
- steering-docs/EXTENSIBILITY_MODEL.md
- steering-docs/ROADMAP.md

Act as an informed engineering sidekick. Challenge scope creep. Do not simply agree. If a requested implementation conflicts with the project constitution, stop and explain the conflict.

Rules:
- Keep Truthwatcher as a single Go binary plus PostgreSQL unless explicitly asked otherwise.
- Do not introduce Docker, Kubernetes, microservices, message brokers, or cloud dependencies.
- Do not introduce write-capable network automation.
- Do not build observability features.
- Do not build a full chat platform before the evidence kernel exists.
- Prefer boring, explicit Go code.
- Add tests where practical.
- Update steering-docs/ROADMAP.md only with completed work and next steps.
- Do not rewrite vision documents unless directly asked.


Task: document MOP generation and config candidate generation design without implementation.

Deliverables:
1. Add a design doc for MOP generation prerequisites, inputs, review flow, and safety boundaries.
2. Add a design doc for config candidate generation prerequisites and hard separation from execution.
3. Explain why both depend on evidence-backed service and graph data.
4. Define non-goals for automatic device execution.
5. Update `docs/future.md` with links to the design docs.

Constraints:
- Do not implement MOP generation.
- Do not implement config rendering.
- Do not add write-capable network automation.

Final response requirement:
- Include a git commit message for the update.
- Render it as raw text in a single fenced `text` code block.
- Do not use bullets or numbered items inside the commit message.
