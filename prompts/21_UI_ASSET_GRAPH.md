Before coding, read these files:
- steering-docs/PROJECT_TRUTHWATCHER.md
- steering-docs/AGENT_COLLABORATION_CONTRACT.md
- steering-docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md
- steering-docs/DATA_MODEL.md
- steering-docs/SAFETY_MODEL.md
- steering-docs/MVP_SPEC.md
- steering-docs/EXTENSIBILITY_MODEL.md
- ROADMAP.md

Act as an informed engineering sidekick. Challenge scope creep. Do not simply agree. If a requested implementation conflicts with the project constitution, stop and explain the conflict.

Rules:
- Keep Truthwatcher as a single Go binary plus PostgreSQL unless explicitly asked otherwise.
- Do not introduce Docker, Kubernetes, microservices, message brokers, or cloud dependencies.
- Do not introduce write-capable network automation.
- Do not build observability features.
- Do not build a full chat platform before the evidence kernel exists.
- Prefer boring, explicit Go code.
- Add tests where practical.
- Update ROADMAP.md only with completed work and next steps.
- Do not rewrite vision documents unless directly asked.


Task: build the first graph view.

Deliverables:
1. Fetch graph JSON from API.
2. Render nodes and edges.
3. Support clicking an asset to show details.
4. Use a lightweight graph library only if needed.
5. Show confidence on edges.

Constraints:
- Keep graph small and simple.
- No complex topology layout yet.
